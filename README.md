# homework-5-calendar

In this calander website we have a timetable that lets you edit for every hour Monday- Friday 7am-7pm. It lets you write in the time blocks, however, it does not save when refreshed. 

It does have the current date and time when refreshed. 

The month button was going to take you to what week you needed your calendar, but that also doesn't work. 

You could say this assignment did not go as planned even though many hours were spent on it.
